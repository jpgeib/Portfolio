                I am proficient in multiple Adobe Creative Cloud applications,
                including: Photoshop, InDesign, Premiere Pro, and Animate. (Examples on the Portfolio page) 
                I also have many years of experience working in Microsoft Office, such as
                Word, PowerPoint, and Excel. Additionally, I have a basic knowledge of
                HTML5, CSS, Javascript, and SQL programming languages.

                I am ideally looking for a position that will allow me
                to utilize my pre-exisiting skills in Adobe, and improve 
                upon them as I use them throughout the job.
